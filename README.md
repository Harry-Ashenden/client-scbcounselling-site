# A Client's Business Counselling Site
This was a multi-page static website I produced for a client providing details about her services in a easy to read layout. It is completely responsive so no matter what device it is viewed on, interested customers can access the site. The client wanted to use forest colours and minimal images to show a clinical approach with the underlying theme of growth shown through the trees.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started this off using a template and had to alter the design a fair amount using CSS. From here I worked with the client to ensure that her needs and design ideas where put into place from the scrolling start to the sliding testimonials. After this was compeleted for a desktop site, I used media queries to ensure a responsive design.

## Optimizations

To further enhance this project if there was more time and the client was in a place to work on this; I would have included a booking form with up to date availbility showing any interested clients a calander where they choose a specific time slot.

## Lessons Learned:

Making this website I learned how to effectively search for code snippets that were available to me and then alter them to suit my needs. This is a time efficient method that allowed me to produce this project faster than without it. I also learned how to integrate contact forms and the correct methods for adding HTML mailto: and tel: addresses.
