								<h2>Lisa Sheppard</h2>
								<p>Lisa Sheppard has been counselling children, adolescents, and adults for almost a decade. Her work is integrative, combining aspects of person-centred, cognitive behavioural and expressive therapies to assess, engage and work toward a resolution based on the client's needs. <br></br>
								
								Lisa's aim is to assist clients in defining their goals and create a supportive and collaborative partnership that facilitates growth, change, relief, and self-fulfilment. Lisa has a particular interest in sandplay therapy. Sandplay is a creative, expressive, and nonverbal therapeutic intervention that can be used with clients of all ages.<br></br>
								
								Clients are invited to create a three-dimensional picture in a sand tray utilising miniature figurines, symbols, and objects. These pictures will often reflect the clients 'inner world' - thoughts, feelings, concepts, beliefs, concerns, experiences, and trauma. <br></br>
								
								Sandplay can bring the unconscious into conscious awareness and provides clients with the opportunity to attain self-awareness, resolve conflict and challenge their obstacles.
