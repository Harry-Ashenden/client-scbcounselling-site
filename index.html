						<section class="wrapper style3 container special">

							<header class="container">
								<h2>Why choose SCB Counselling?</h2>
								<p>Schools trust SCB counsellors to provide their students with the care they need when they need it most. A school counsellor is a very privileged role, trusted with the emotional needs of often very vulnerable children, on a one-to-one basis. That's why all SCB counsellors are fully qualified, have a membership to the BACP or NCS, and are all DBS-checked and insured. It is imperative that any school that secures a counsellor, can completely trust who is working with their children. <br></br>

								SCB counsellors are also highly experienced, enabling them to meet the needs of every school that they are based in, adapting, and flexibly providing the support that is required. <br></br>
									
								If you feel that your school would benefit from an SCB Counsellor, get in touch with <a href="contact.html">Sarah</a> who will happily discuss your requirements, hours required, contract and costs.

										<p>We have been fortunate to have had the support of SCB Counselling services for over twelve years now. Our relationship has passed the test of time due to the reliability and quality of the service provided, the warm professionalism of the counsellors and the supportive relationships that they build with their clients: pupils, staff and parents. They have become valued members of our St. Mary's community and we cannot recommend the counsellors and their service highly enough.</p>

										<p>We have had SCB Counselling services at our school for many years and I could not recommend them highly enough.  Throughout the time of having Lisa and Sarah as our children's counsellors, I'm constantly hearing from the children how much they look forward to their session and the huge impact it has had on their lives. As for us adults, the supervision that is provided by Sarah is second to none and even when I feel like I'm fine, a conversation with Sarah either confirms that or allows me to open up to stresses I may have been burying. Thank you so very much! </p>

										<p>I cannot endorse Sarah Baker highly enough - she is by far the finest and most skilled counsellor I have worked with in schools.  I have referred pupils with extreme emotional problems to Sarah and her expertise at enabling them to understand their feelings and emotions has provided them with strategies to flourish.  Sarah is full of warmth, empathy and kindness whilst at the same time being professionally astute.  Her confidentiality is watertight yet if there is a concern of a safeguarding nature, she will raise this without hesitation.</p>

										<p>Sarah and her team are an absolutely invaluable resource in our school. Not only have they worked long term with our pupils, but they have stepped in during difficult times to ensure that they are fully supported and able to manage in school.  They have developed great professional relationships with the children and work alongside staff, so that we are also better able to support them ourselves.</p>
