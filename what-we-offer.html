											<h3>Counselling for children</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The SCB Counselling services are designed with children in mind, offering therapy based on children's individual needs. Providing much needed support and guidance assists children dealing with troublesome times, at home and at school. Sometimes children feel like no one understands what they're going through, but the team at SCB Counselling reassure them that the school always care about their well-being and wants to help them reach their full potential. <br></br>

										SCB counsellors work with students of all ages, from Reception through to Year 13 and children who attend PRU schools. The counsellors help children manage and regulate their emotions and focus on helping the students feel safe and secure in their school community.<br></br>
										
										Every SCB Counsellor uses a variety of therapeutic techniques when working with children, dependent on the individual needs of the child. These include:
										<ul>
											<li>Play therapy techniques </li>
											<li>Sand play</li>
											<li>Arts & crafts</li>
											<li>Child Led Talking therapy</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
										The Team at SCB Counselling have extensive experience in supporting children that are working with Social Care: Looked After Children, children on Child Protection or Child in Need plans, and working closely with Safeguarding Leads in schools. The counsellors work collaboratively with the pastoral team, ensuring clear, concise communication at all times.

											<h3>Counselling for families</h3>
										</header>
										<p>SCB Counselling offers whole family support and where appropriate, can provide child and parent counselling, empowering parents to feel more confident in the relationships that they have with their children. They also offer the option of counselling for parents on a one-to-one basis, which is an extension of the support a child needs. Accessing external counselling services can sometimes prove difficult and a school counsellor can provide a quicker route to support for a parent in crisis.

											<h3>Counselling for staff</h3>
										</header>
										<p>In addition to supporting students in their personal development, SCB Counselling offers support for teachers and staff at schools, including one-to-one staff counselling or staff supervision. The team gives everyone a safe space to talk and strives to forge relationships with SENCOs, Safeguarding Leads, Pastoral Managers, Learning Mentors, and SLTs.<br></br>
											
											School staff work tirelessly to meet all the needs of the children in their care. Some of the issues that staff encounter can have an impact on their emotional well-being, and this can often carry over into home life. The team understand that working in a stressful environment can take its toll. Providing staff with access to a qualified counsellor who will confidently listen to them, can support and empower them to continue their work with a clearer mind. <br></br>
											
											The SCB Counselling Team are able to provide Counselling support for whomever you feel needs it within your school community.
